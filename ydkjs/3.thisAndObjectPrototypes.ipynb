When a function is invoked, an activation record, otherwise known as an execution context, is created. This record contains information about where the function was called from (the call stack), how the function was invoked, what parameters were passed etc. One of the properties of this record is the <code>this</code> reference, which will be used for the duration of that functions execution. <code>this</code> is actually a binding that is made when a function is invoked, and what it references is determined entirely by the call-site where the function is called."
